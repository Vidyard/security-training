Welcome to Vidyard's Annual Security Awareness Training! 

This year I have opted for a new approach, and I am using PagerDuty's public and Open Source Security Awareness Training. It has been completely re-written to suit the processes, policies, threats, and compliance requirements that Vidyard must align/adhere to. 

For more information on Pagerduty's training program, please see "[PagerDuty's Employee Security Training](https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/security-training-at-pagerduty)".



The first training deck is mandatory for all staff, while the next deck is mandatory for only those in a technical, engineering, or support role. If you're not in one of those roles, feel free to check it out anyway!
